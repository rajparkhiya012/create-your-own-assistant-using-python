# create-your-own-assistant-using-python
Hello dear friends, I am very happy to say that I have created an AI assistant. Which I have created for my personal use. But I hope that if this project is worked on, it will become more smart, automatic and very good. I am uploading all this no source code below. And I will also mention how to use it. I hope you see it and use it.

This entire project is made in Python. And if you want to make the user interface creative and attractive, then you can do that too. First of all, run the file named jarvis.py. It will run along with it, app.py will also run, so your project will run. You will have to use some Python commands so that you can easily record voice and convert voice to text.
